# finite_element_simulation

Given a 2D circular object with radius 1, the material of the object can be anything, such as aluminum, iron, magnesium, glass, etc. Then, an external force is given from the top of the object (the force magnitude can be different). Can you write a code that can visualize the effect of the external force to the object, and discuss about the plane stress, plane strain, displacement, etc?

The method that I used is triangulation. The full report is written is final_report.docx. There, I discussed about the method I used, how to implement it, and also the results. The discussion includes the effect of different number of triangles in triangulation method, the effect of the size of the object, the place where the plane strain and the plane stress is the highest, and the effect of element type (different element has different Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio).
